# Docker Build and Push Pipeline
# ============================================================================
# This workflow builds a Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub
# Flow: GitHub Push → Build Docker Image → Push to Docker Hub
# ============================================================================

name: Docker Build & Push

# TRIGGER CONDITIONS
# ------------------
# This workflow runs on every push to main or develop branches
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# ---------------------
# Global variables available to all jobs in this workflow
env:
  DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME: liberia-islamic-schools  # Change this to your Docker Hub username/image-name
  DOCKER_REGISTRY: docker.io                   # Docker Hub registry

# ============================================================================
# JOBS SECTION
# ============================================================================
# Jobs run in parallel by default unless dependencies are specified with 'needs'
# Each job runs in a fresh virtual machine (Ubuntu Linux in this case)
# ============================================================================

jobs:
  # ==========================================================================
  # JOB 1: CODE QUALITY & LINTING
  # ==========================================================================
  # Purpose: Ensure code meets quality standards before building
  # This catches syntax errors, type issues, and style problems early
  # ==========================================================================
  lint:
    name: Code Quality Check  # Display name shown in GitHub UI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    # Use latest Ubuntu virtual machine
    
    steps:
      # STEP 1: Get the code
      # ---------------------
      # actions/checkout@v3 is a GitHub Action that clones your repository
      # This makes the code available to subsequent steps
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # STEP 2: Setup Node.js environment
      # ----------------------------------
      # actions/setup-node@v3 installs Node.js and npm
      # 'cache: npm' speeds up the workflow by caching node_modules
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}  # Use the version from env
          cache: 'npm'  # Cache npm dependencies for faster builds

      # STEP 3: Install project dependencies
      # -------------------------------------
      # 'npm ci' is like 'npm install' but faster and more reliable for CI
      # It uses package-lock.json to ensure exact versions
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # STEP 4: Run ESLint linter
      # --------------------------
      # Checks code for style issues and potential bugs
      # --if-present only runs if the script exists in package.json
      # continue-on-error: true means workflow continues even if this fails
      - name: Run ESLint
        run: npm run lint --if-present
        continue-on-error: true

      # STEP 5: TypeScript type checking
      # ---------------------------------
      # Verifies all TypeScript types are correct
      # --noEmit means it only checks types without generating files
      - name: Check TypeScript types
        run: npx tsc --noEmit
        continue-on-error: true

  # ==========================================================================
  # JOB 2: BUILD FRONTEND
  # ==========================================================================
  # Purpose: Compile the React/Vite frontend application into static files
  # The 'needs: lint' means this job waits for lint job to complete first
  # ==========================================================================
  build-frontend:
    name: Build Frontend
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: lint  # Wait for lint job to finish before starting
    
    steps:
      # Clone the repository code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Setup Node.js with caching for faster builds
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
          cache: 'npm'

      # Install all dependencies from package-lock.json
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # STEP: Build the frontend application
      # -------------------------------------
      # 'npm run build' runs the Vite build process
      # This creates optimized production files in the dist/ folder
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
        env:
          CI: false  # Disable CI strict mode (warnings won't fail the build)
          VITE_API_URL: ${{ secrets.VITE_API_URL }}  # API URL from GitHub Secrets

      # STEP: Upload build artifacts
      # -----------------------------
      # Artifacts are files saved from this job that other jobs can download
      # The dist/ folder contains our built frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)
      # retention-days: 7 means artifacts are kept for 7 days
      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: frontend-build  # Name to identify this artifact
          path: dist/           # Folder to upload
          retention-days: 7     # How long to keep the artifact

  # ==========================================================================
  # JOB 3: BUILD BACKEND
  # ==========================================================================
  # Purpose: Compile the Express.js backend TypeScript code to JavaScript
  # Runs in parallel with build-frontend (both need lint to finish first)
  # ==========================================================================
  build-backend:
    name: Build Backend
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: lint  # Wait for lint job to complete
    
    steps:
      # Clone the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Setup Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js

        with:
          node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
          cache: 'npm'

      # STEP: Install backend dependencies
      # ------------------------------------
      # The backend code is in the server/ folder
      # We need to cd (change directory) into it first
      # The | symbol allows multiple commands to run sequentially
      - name: Install backend dependencies
        run: |
          cd server
          npm ci

      # STEP: Build backend
      # --------------------
      # Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
      # --if-present means only run if build script exists
      - name: Build backend
        run: |
          cd server
          npm run build --if-present

      # Upload the compiled backend code for later jobs to use

        with:
          name: backend-build
          path: server/dist/  # Upload the compiled JavaScript files
          retention-days: 7

  # ==========================================================================
  # JOB 4: RUN TESTS
  # ==========================================================================
  # Purpose: Execute all test suites to ensure code works correctly
  # needs: [build-frontend, build-backend] means this waits for BOTH builds
  # This ensures our built code is tested before deployment
  # ==========================================================================
  test:
    name: Run Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build-frontend, build-backend]  # Wait for both builds to complete
    
    steps:
      # Clone the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Setup Node.js

          cache: 'npm'

      # Install frontend dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # STEP: Run frontend tests
      # -------------------------
      # Executes test files (usually files ending in .test.ts or .spec.ts)
      # CI: true enables CI mode (non-interactive, fails on errors)
      - name: Run frontend tests
        run: npm test --if-present
        env:
          CI: true  # Run tests in CI mode (non-interactive)

      # Install backend dependencies
      - name: Install backend dependencies
        run: |
          cd server

          cd server
          npm test --if-present
        env:
          CI: true

  # ==========================================================================
  # JOB 5: SECURITY AUDIT
  # ==========================================================================
  # Purpose: Scan dependencies for known security vulnerabilities
  # This job runs independently (no 'needs') so it runs in parallel
  # Helps catch security issues before they reach production
  # ==========================================================================
  security:
    name: Security Audit
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      # Clone the repository
      - name: Checkout code

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}

      # STEP: Audit frontend dependencies
      # -----------------------------------
      # npm audit checks for known security vulnerabilities
      # --audit-level=moderate means only report moderate+ severity issues
      # continue-on-error: true means don't fail the entire workflow
      - name: Run npm audit (Frontend)
        run: npm audit --audit-level=moderate
        continue-on-error: true  # Don't block deployment for audit warnings

      # STEP: Audit backend dependencies
      # ----------------------------------
      # Same security check for the backend packages
      - name: Run npm audit (Backend)
        run: |
          cd server
          npm audit --audit-level=moderate
        continue-on-error: true

  # ==========================================================================
  # JOB 6: DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION
  # ==========================================================================
  # Purpose: Deploy the application to production servers
  # This only runs when code is pushed to the main branch
  # ==========================================================================
  deploy-production:
    name: Deploy to Production
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [test, security]  # Wait for tests and security audit to complete
    # CONDITIONAL EXECUTION:
    # This job only runs if ALL these conditions are true:
    # 1. The branch is 'main' (refs/heads/main)
    # 2. The event is a 'push' (not a pull_request)
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
    # ENVIRONMENT:
    # Defines the deployment environment for tracking and protection rules
    environment:
      name: production

    steps:
      # Clone the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # STEP: Download build artifacts
      # --------------------------------
      # Get the frontend files that were built in the build-frontend job
      # These files are stored as artifacts and can be downloaded by name
      - name: Download frontend artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: frontend-build  # Must match the name used in upload

        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: backend-build
          path: server/dist/

      # STEP: Deploy to hosting platforms
      # -----------------------------------
      # This is a placeholder - you'll add actual deployment commands
      # Different hosting platforms have different deployment methods:
      #
      # VERCEL (Frontend):
      #   npx vercel --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
      #
      # RAILWAY (Backend):
      #   railway up
      #
      # RENDER (Auto-deploys):
      #   Just push to main branch - Render watches your repo
      #
      # The ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }} syntax accesses secrets stored in
      # GitHub repository settings (Settings → Secrets → Actions)
      - name: Deploy to Render/Railway/Vercel
        run: |
          echo "🚀 Deploying to production..."
          # Add your deployment commands here
          # Examples:
          # - Vercel: npx vercel --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          # - Railway: railway up
          # - Render: Auto-deploys on git push
        env:
          DEPLOY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}  # Access GitHub Secret

      # STEP: Notify deployment success
      # ---------------------------------
      # if: success() means this only runs if previous steps succeeded
      - name: Notify deployment success
        if: success()
        run: |
          echo "✅ Deployment successful!"

  # ==========================================================================
  # JOB 7: DEPLOY TO STAGING
  # ==========================================================================
  # Purpose: Deploy to staging/testing environment
  # This runs when code is pushed to the 'develop' branch
  # Allows testing features before merging to production
  # ==========================================================================
  deploy-staging:
    name: Deploy to Staging
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [test]  # Wait for tests to pass (faster than production)
    # CONDITIONAL: Only run on develop branch pushes
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop' && github.event_name == 'push'
    environment:
      name: staging  # Staging environment for testing
      url: https://staging.liberia-islamic-schools.com
    
    steps:
      # Clone the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Download the built frontend files
      - name: Download frontend artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:

      # STEP: Deploy to staging environment
      # -------------------------------------
      # Similar to production deployment but for testing
      # You can add staging-specific deployment commands here
      - name: Deploy to Staging
        run: |
          echo "🚀 Deploying to staging..."
          # Add your staging deployment commands here
          # This could be a staging server, preview deployment, etc.
